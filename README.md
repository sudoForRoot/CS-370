This repository contains my project work for CS-370-11968-M01 (Current/Emerging Trends in CS) during the Winter 2026 term (Jan-Mar), where I developed a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning and neural networks. The agent learns to navigate a grid environment to locate treasure through Deep Q-Learning (DQN), implementing key concepts such as Q-learning algorithms, neural network architectures for function approximation, epsilon-greedy exploration strategies, and experience replay memory buffers for stable training. The repository includes the main Jupyter notebook Pirate_Intelligent_Agent.ipynb containing the complete agent implementation, this README file with project documentation, and a requirements.txt file listing all Python dependencies. To run this project, simply clone the repository, install the required packages (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras, jupyter), and launch the notebook. Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights into how emerging AI trends like deep reinforcement learning can solve practical navigation problems, particularly understanding how reward structures shape agent behavior, the critical balance between exploration and exploitation, and the importance of ethical considerations when deploying autonomous systems. This work demonstrates the practical application of course concepts to real-world AI challenges while maintaining awareness of the broader implications of intelligent systems.
